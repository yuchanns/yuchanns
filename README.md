Hi there~I'm [@yuchanns](https://github.com/yuchanns), having a fregquently used Chinese nickname 科学搜查官 which is a profession of [Ema Skye](https://w.atwiki.jp/aniwotawiki/pages/31294.html) from the video game Phoenix Wright.

And my avatar was illustrated by a friend, a gopher drinking coffe and coding,  which acts as one sticker of Bronya from mobile game honkai3.

I'm a backend developer using Golang as the main language. I also have some appreciation on Rust and Lisp.

An ambisious target is to hold a setup of Computer Science from the bottom up. I wish to be a **Lifelong** CS user.

You can touch me with [email](mailto:airamusume@gmail.com).
