Hi there~I'm [@yuchanns](https://github.com/yuchanns), having a fregquently used Chinese nickname 科学搜查官 which is a profession of [Ema Skye](https://w.atwiki.jp/aniwotawiki/pages/31294.html) from the video game Phoenix Wright.

And my avatar was illustrated by a friend, a gopher drinking coffe and coding,  which acts as one sticker of Bronya from mobile game honkai3.

I have my own blog theme [gatsby-theme-yuchanns](https://github.com/yuchanns/gatsby-theme-yuchanns) powerd by [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). It combines styles of github and reddit. You may expect an implementation with [vuerpess-next](https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-next) once it is released.

Up to present I talked all about frontend. As a matter of fact, I'm a backend developer working with php, python and go. Pleasure to be a gopher.

Besides, I have particular appreciation on Lisp and Rust.

An ambisious target is to hold a setup of Computer Science from the bottom up. I wish to be a **Lifelong** CS user.

You can touch me with [email](mailto:airamusume@gmail.com).
