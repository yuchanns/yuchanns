# Backlink

* A backlink for a given web resource is a link from some other website (the
  referrer) to that web resource (the referent). A web resource may be (for
  example) a website, web page, or web directory.
    * A backlink is a reference comparable to a citation. 
    * The quantity, quality, and relevance of backlinks for a web page are
      among the factors that search engines like Google evaluate in order to
      estimate how important the page is.
    * PageRank calculates the score for each web page based on how all the web 
      pages are connected among themselves, and is one of the variables that Google
      Search uses to determine how high a web page should go in search results.
    * This weighting of backlinks is analogous to citation analysis of books, 
      scholarly papers, and academic journals.
    * A Topical PageRank has been researched and implemented as well, which gives 
      more weight to backlinks coming from the page of a same topic as a target 
      page.
