* Today's Asahi [[M1 Sway 全纪实|post/sway-on-m1-full-record]]
    * Enable Wayland Support on Startup 
        * In my case, I use bash as the shell so I append below to ~/.bash_profile
            ```bash
            if [ "$XDG_SESSION_TYPE" == "wayland" ]; then
                export MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
            fi
            ```
    * Configure Sway
        * First install wlroots (which will install seatd first) and add yourself the group seat then enable seatd
            ```bash
            paru -S wlroots
            sudo gpasswd -a $USER seat
            systemctl enable seatd
            ```
        * Install Sway
            ```bash
            paru -S sway
            ```
    * GPG Key under Wayland
        * GPG prompt works normally under X11 but will fail with Wayland which gets: `gpg failed to sign the data fatal: failed to write commit object.` 
        * We can use pinentry-qt to resolve that problem
            ```bash
            paru -S pinentry # this install a bunch of pinentry binaries

            cat <<'EOF' > ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
            pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-qt
            EOF

            gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye
            ```
          Then we are able to enter password with a qt prompt
